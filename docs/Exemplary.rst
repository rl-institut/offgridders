==========================================
Exemplary electricity supply systems
==========================================

Currently, following operational modes will be analyzed, mostly with capacities resulting from the base case:

* Off-grid micro grid with fixed capacities
* Off-grid micro grid interconnecting to national grid (consumption)
* Off-grid micro grid interconnecting to national grid (consumption and feed-in)
* Optimal local capacities for off-grid site with national grid access

The results of the oemof-optimizations have to be interpreted considering the evaluated scenario. Further details on this can be found in `Evaluation of oemof results <https://offgridders.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Evaluation.html>`_.

(Are these features or are they part of the result? If feels like this list (Dispatch,Off-grid micro..) needs a caption or a title)\

* **Dispatch optimization of off-grid micro grid** with base case capacities.
* **Off-grid micro grid** with base case capacities interconnecting with national grid:
    * Only consumption from national grid
    * Consumption from and feed-in to national grid

Off-grid micro grid interconnecting to national grid
-----------------------------------------------------
This case analyses the dispatch of the capacities in an implemented off-grid microgrid, sized within the base case scenario. It takes into account blackout events. To eliminate the influence of blackouts on this case set both _blackout_duration_ and _blackout_frequency_ in the input list to 0.With this configuration two cases can be analyzed:

1) **Only electricity consumption**:
An interconnection with the main grid only allows consumption from the national grid through the point of common coupling, as long as the grid is not subject to blackouts.

2) **Electricity consumption and feed-in**:
An interconnection with the main grid allows consumption from, as well as feed-into the national grid through the point of common coupling, as long as the grid is not subject to blackouts.

Optimal local capacities for off-grid site with national grid access
---------------------------------------------------------------------
An optimization of backup-capacities of an off-grid site already connected to a blackout-ridden national grid is performed. (Following pictures present the results?)
