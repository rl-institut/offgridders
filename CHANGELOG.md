## [Offgridders V4.2] - 2020-06-30

### Added
- `total_excess_annual_kWh` to list of output parameters. Calculation: `total_excess_annual_kWh = total_excess_ac_annual_kWh + total_excess_dc_annual` (#73)
- Optional parameters and their default values `fuel_co2_emission_factor` (2.68 kgCO2eq/l diesel) and `maingrid_co2_emission_factor` (0.9 kgCO2eq/kWh) to input template, sheet `input_constant` and module `B` (#77)
- Calculation of C02 emissions and new output value: `co2_emissions_kgCO2eq`. It is based on the kWh consumption from the national grid (before transfromer station losses) and diesel consumption (#77)

### Changed

### Removed

### Fixed
- Typo when calling for the inverter capacity ('capacity_inverter_dc_ac_kW' and not 'capacity_inverter_kW'), (#75)
- Typo for unit of `maingrid_extension_lifetime` (a)

## [Offgridders V4.1] - 2020-06-30

### Added
- readthedocs.yml file (#59)

### Changed
- Moved Wiki to Readthedocs (#41)
- Changed class structure to modules/functions (#53)
- Script A0 was refactored to Offgridders. It runs now through python Offgridders.py YOUR_INPUT_EXCEL_SHEET_PATH (#53)

### Fixed
- Compilation of readthedocs by changing advanced settings on readthedocs.io (#59)

## [Offgridders V4.0] 2020-04-30

### Added
- Multi-Criteria Analysis (MCA), a post-processing comparison of the optimization results with H0 and H1
- Plotting bar charts of most relevant criteria
- Calculation of total first time investment costs ("first_investment") and total O&M costs ("operation_mantainance_expenditures")

### Changed
- Changelog.md was updated with old release infos
- requirements.txt: added scipy, xlsxwriter 
- test_input_template.xlsx: Setting whether to perform the multicriteria analysis (MCA) in settings tab; Electricity sales tariff (for MCA only) in case_definitions
- test_input_template.xlsx: New tab "multicriteria_data": weights of dimensions and criteria (all with default values) and which sensibility parameters should be included in the MCA
- A0 to call MCA
- B to read data from xlsx for MCA
- C: Extend set of parameters that are an output of simulation by "total_pv_generation_kWh", "total_wind_generation_kWh", "total_genset_generation_kWh"

### Removed

## Offgridders V3.1.1 [2020-04-01]

Intermediary release, maily focussing on restructuring the code into a code folder and adding a readthedocs.
Readthedocs is still dysfunctional. When starting to use Offgridders, please use release v3.1.

## Offgridders v3.1 [2020-04-01]
Release that includes all changes up to October 2019
- Version that is used for PSBs Cobrador paper + Book chapter
- Version that is used for MMHs Backup system paper

Info: Up to this point, no Changelog.md was in place. Changes will be tracked more carefully starting v4.0

## oesmot v3.0 (22.07.2019)
Working title of tool:
oesmot - Open Electricity System Modelling and Optimization Tool

- New excel template - not compatible with previous versions
- Taking into account investments into storage power
Remark: Currently working with oemof 0.2.2

Features:
- AC- and DC-bus, allowing AC- and DC-demand, connected through inverter/rectifier
- DC-side: Storage, PV panels
- AC-side: Wind plant, diesel generator, transformer station to (weak) central grid
- All inputs defined through excel input sheet
- Supported: Sensitivity analysis and definition of multiple electricity systems at once
- Supports constraints: Renewable share constraint, stability constraints (3 versions), max. allowed shortage
- Outputs saved in csv, automatic generation of electricity flow graphs
- Error messages & warnings


## MicroGridDesignTool_V2.1
- Error messages
- Bugfix: Working renewable constraint
- Bugfix: Excel-issues with max_shortage=='default' error (from columns='unnamed')

## MicroGridDesignTool_V2.0
Major changes:
- New excel template
- DC and AC bus, connected with inverters/rectifiers, possible AC/DC demand
- Forced battery charge criteria (linearized)
- Minimal renewable share criteria not working!
- Console execution via "python3 A_main_script.py FILE.xlsx"

## MicroGridDesignTool_V1.1
- Fixed termination due to undefined 'comments', occurring when simulation without sensitivity analysis is performed
- New constraint: Renewable share (testing needed)
- Added DC bus including rectifier/inverter (testing needed -> Flows, calculated values)
- Enabled demand AC + demand DC (testing needed -> Flows, calculated values)
- PV charge only through battery can be enabled by not inluding a rectifier (testing needed -> Flows, calculated values)
- New Constraint: Linearized forced charge when national grid available
- New Constraint: Discharge of battery only when maingrid experiences blackout
- New Constraint: Inverter from DC to AC bus only active when blackout occurs

## MicroGridDesignTool_V1.0
- Simulation of off- or on-grid energy system (not only MG)
- 1 hr timesteps, 1 to 365 days evaluation time
- All input data via excel sheet
- Easy case definition
